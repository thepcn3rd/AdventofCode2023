# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my adventure in working on the challenges presented by "Advent of Code 2023".  You can find the challenge here: https://adventofcode.com/2023/about

By clicking on the day or the challenge name you are taken to the page of the challenge.  Each challenge has 2 parts to it and a link to my code for those parts follows.

[Day 3 - Gear Ratios](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3) - Code [Part 1](/day3/day3-challenge1.go) - [Part 2 (Incomplete)](/day3-challenge2_Incomplete.go)

I could easily identify and find the number but it being related to a larger number was more challenging.
